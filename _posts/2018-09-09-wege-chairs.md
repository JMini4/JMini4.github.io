title: Wege Chairs
subtitle: Fine for 1 person but 2?

I recall my first time trying to pull one of these chairs out. I didn't understand the swiveling nature of them. Once you get past that the chairs seem very efficient, many chairs in a small space without the clutter and noise of traditional chairs. Below we have the set up of the chairs.

Everything seems great until you reach the end of class and both you and your neighbor go to leave at the same time. Now since every other pair of chairs swivels toward the same point, you knock knees with your neighbor. As seen below the chairs get sort of awkwardly wedged together.

These chairs are interesting to look at and use but when it comes to comfort and the ability to get out of your seat without disrupting your neighbor they are quite bad. I would argue that the desk and chair arrangement in Wege is not worth the sophistication, regular desks and chairs are superior. Having a chair fixed to a pivot like this only reduces clutter which is not something that the user is mmediately concerned with.
