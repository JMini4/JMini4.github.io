title: Research Paper Report
subtitle: the problem of wayfinding and how it relates to my group project
---

The article I chose to read is about a possible alternative to visual wayfinding. One of the main foundations the paper builds on was identifying the four main tasks that are associated with wayfinding: “Orienting oneself in the environment, choosing the route, keeping on track, and recognizing that the destination has been reached” (2). I find this to be extremely believable because my group discovered during usability testing that some of the main tasks that are fundamental to wayfinding were not originally supported by our design. Specifically, users were struggling to know when the destination had been reached. Another point of the research paper is that traditional forms of navigation such as visual and auditory are not sufficient because these forms distract the user from their environment which could be dangerous or annoying or both depending on where the user is. I also find this point to be true because that is one of the main things that our group grappled with in the early stages of the project: how not to take the necessary attention of the user away from the already rich experience of a museum. The article proposes a “tactile wayfinder” which uses vibrations to inform the user of which direction to go.  The modality the researchers have chosen is a belt that has 6 vibrators at 60 degree intervals around the hips of the user along we a PDA or personal digital assistant that shows a visual map of the space. I was shocked that this was the modality they decided on but was really convinced by the second experiment they did where they put users in a field and ask them to follow the directions given by the belt. The users managed to stay within a relatively small distance from the ideal path and the researchers even described that when they make the target zones smaller for the navigation task, the users stay on route even more accurately. 

After reading this paper I am realizing that although one of our main goals was to choose a design and a modality that does not distract users from the experience of the museum, I fear that the distraction is inevitable since we rely on auditory and visual inputs. In general though really almost any app would fail in the eyes of these researchers because  "displays require the user’s attention while interpreting the visual presentation".(3) However, we do try to utilize the vibration capabilities of the smart watch, I do not that think we have completely harnessed all of the possible ways that the smart watch can make navigation less distracting. I am not sure if it would be reasonable to do something like a smaller version of the tactile belt, but wrapped around the wrist of the user. I think that the authors of the paper would not approve of our design at all because we rely on audio as part of the solution to one of our tasks and because we use a similar combination of landmarks and visual prompting of direction. I also think the argument could be made that museums are exactly the kind of space where a user wants to direct most if not all of their attention to the museum. The users attention is already split into worrying about not bumping into other patrons, looking at the art, and potentially engaging in conversation with fellow visitors. So according to the researchers I do not think they would find our design to be one that makes progress on the problem that they aim to tackle. I want to push our group to think about how we could incorporate more clever vibrations as a solution to wayfinding.
